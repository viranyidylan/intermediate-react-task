# Weather App Work Sample Test

## Before you start

- Go to [OpenWeatherAPI](https://openweathermap.org/api) to sign up and get your own API key
- Test your API key by making a few API requests to make sure it is working properly

## Timestamp your progress

Please start a timer as soon as you begin working on this task and make a note of the time when you finish. This will help us understand the amount of time you spent on the task.

## Task 1: Add a details view

Create a details view that displays more detailed information about each city's weather. The view should display:
- temperature
- humidity
- wind speed
- 5-day forecast

## Task 2: Add lazy loading

Add lazy loading to the details view so that it is only loaded when the user clicks on a city to view its details, improving the overall performance of the app.

## Task 3: Add caching of API requests

Add caching to the API requests to reduce the number of API calls and improve performance. You may implement a manual cache or use a caching library, but it does not have to be production suitable.
