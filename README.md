# React Weather App Assessment

## Introduction

This task is designed to evaluate your skills as a React developer. You will enhance a basic weather app by adding new features and performance optimizations. Please limit your total working time to 90 minutes, with 45 minutes dedicated to each task. This test is not about going the extra mile or investing extra time.

It is important to note that completing every subtask within the time frame is not the ultimate measure of success. The goal of these tasks is to assess your problem-solving skills and approach to performance considerations, rather than just checking if you can finish everything in the given time.

## The endpoints

This project uses json-server as a fake weather data REST API 

To spin up the mock backend you need to run the following command in the terminal:

`json-server --watch db.json --routes routes.json --port 3004`

This will start a local server on port 3004, with the routes that are specified in the routes.json file and the data from the db.json file. 

eg `http://localhost:3004/cities`

## Task 1: Add a Search Bar to the Weather App

As a user, I want to have a search bar that I can use to search for cities with weather data available and add them to the dashboard.

Steps:
1. Add a search bar to the top of the app that allows the user to search for cities by name.
2. When the user starts typing in the search bar, a dropdown should appear with suggestions for cities that match what the user has typed so far (You should use the endpoint: `http://localhost:3004/cities?name_like=${SearchTerm}`).
3. When the user selects a city from the dropdown, the detailed weather information for that city should be displayed in a modal.
4. Add a button labeled "Add to Dashboard" to the modal. When the user clicks this button, the selected city should be added to the dashboard of cards, with the detailed weather information displayed.
5. The dashboard of cards should have a button labeled "Remove" on each card. When the user clicks this button, the corresponding card should be removed from the dashboard.
6. Implement a maximum limit of 5 cards on the dashboard, so that users can only add up to 5 cities at a time. If a user tries to add a 6th city, they should see an error message indicating that the limit has been reached.
7. Implement a rate limiting feature to limit the number of API calls that can be made in a given time period.

## Task 2: Show Details Modal

As a user, I want to be able to click to see more detailed weather information for a city.

Steps: 
1. Add a button labeled "Details" on each card that, when clicked, will reveal the detailed weather information (You can use the endpoint: `http://localhost:3004/cities/{CityName}`).
2. The detailed weather information should include the following:
    - Humidity
    - Wind speed
    - Visibility
    - Pressure
3. When the user clicks the "Details" button on a card, the detailed information should be displayed in a modal.
4. Optimize the performance of the app so that the detailed information is only fetched when the user clicks the "Details" button, and the information is then cached for future use. You can use a simple in-memory cache to store the results of the API call.
5. To demonstrate performance optimization, the detailed information for each city should only be fetched once, even if the user clicks the "Details" button multiple times.
